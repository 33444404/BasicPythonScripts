### Concepts to be looked at ###
* Ontologies
* Machine learning
* Deep learning
* Propositional logic
* Predicate logic
* Natural Language Processing
* Probably Python
* Maybe some Microsoft Cognitive Services tech

### How do I get set up? ###

* [Install Python](https://realpython.com/installing-python/)
* Ensure that pip or pip3 is installed, else [click here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pip)
